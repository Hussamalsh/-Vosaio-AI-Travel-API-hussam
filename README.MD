## Project Overview

The Vosaio AI Travel API generates travel itineraries based on user input. Users provide details such as destination, travel dates, budget, and interests, and the API returns a structured itinerary (including hotels, activities, restaurants, estimated costs, and timings) generated by an AI model.

Key features:
- REST API built with ASP.NET Core Web API.
- AI integration using the OpenAI API.
- Data persistence via Entity Framework Core (using an in-memory database for testing).
- Comprehensive error handling, validation, and logging.
- Unit testing using NUnit and Moq.
- Swagger for API documentation.

## AI Integration Explanation

The API uses the OpenAI API to generate itineraries. Key points:

- **AI Model:**  
  We leverage a GPT-based model (via OpenAI API) to generate itineraries. The prompt is built dynamically based on the user’s input.

- **Prompt Building:**  
  A dedicated `PromptBuilder` (implementing `IPromptBuilder`) constructs a prompt that instructs the AI to return a JSON output conforming to a predefined schema. This ensures consistency and eases deserialization.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The AI integration service (`AIIntegrationService`) handles errors from the AI API, validating responses, and ensuring the JSON output matches the expected schema.

- **Abstraction:**  
  To support unit testing and maintainability, we created abstractions (`IOpenAIClient` and `IChatEndpoint`) along with adapters (`OpenAIClientAdapter`, `ChatEndpointAdapter`), which allow us to decouple our code from the sealed OpenAI library classes.

**Key Points:**
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Controllers handle HTTP interactions, Services encapsulate business logic (including AI integration), and Repositories manage data persistence.
- **Dependency Injection:**  
  All components are registered via DI in Program.cs.
- **SOLID Principles:**  
  Each class/interface has a single responsibility, and abstractions are used to decouple components.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Tests are implemented using NUnit and Moq. They cover key scenarios for AI integration, business logic, and data access.
- **Running Tests:**  
  You can run tests using the following command:

  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```

## Things to Improve

While the current implementation meets the challenge requirements, here are several areas for improvement:

1. **Persistent Storage:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     Uses an in-memory database via EF Core.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Switch to a persistent database (e.g., SQLite or SQL Server) for production. This can be achieved by updating the EF Core configuration based on environment settings.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling & Resilience:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     Basic error handling is implemented in services.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Implement global exception handling middleware, improve logging with structured and correlation IDs, and consider retry policies for external API calls.

3. **Caching & Performance Optimization:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     No caching is implemented.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Implement caching strategies (e.g., in-memory caching or Redis) to avoid re-fetching itineraries or redundant AI API calls.

4. **Scalability:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     Basic API design that handles requests sequentially.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Explore asynchronous processing and load balancing techniques. Consider moving AI requests to background tasks or using message queues for high-load scenarios.

5. **Security Enhancements:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     API key and configuration are loaded from appsettings.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Secure sensitive configuration using user secrets, environment variables, or Azure Key Vault. Add authentication and authorization to protect endpoints.

6. **Extensibility of AI Integration:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     Uses a single AI integration method.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Consider adding support for multiple AI providers (like Azure OpenAI or Cognitive Services) or enabling model selection via configuration.

7. **API Documentation & Client SDK:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     Swagger is enabled for API documentation.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Expand API documentation and provide an SDK or Postman collection to facilitate integration by third-party developers.

8. **Testing & Code Coverage:**  
   - **Current State:**  
     Unit tests cover core functionality.  
   - **Improvement:**  
     Increase test coverage for edge cases, integration tests for the API endpoints, and consider performance/load testing to ensure scalability.
